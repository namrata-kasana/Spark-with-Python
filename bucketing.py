# Here's a Spark Bucketing example demonstrating how to improve join and aggregation performance:
#
# Scenario:
#
# Imagine you have a large dataset containing user purchase transactions. You frequently perform aggregations (e.g., total amount spent) or joins (e.g., joining with user data) based on the customer_id column. If customer_id has a skewed distribution (a few customers have many purchases), these operations might suffer due to data shuffling across partitions.
#
# Bucketing Approach:
#
# Identify Bucketing Column: Choose the column you use frequently for joins or aggregations (e.g., customer_id in this case).
#
# Define Number of Buckets: Select a suitable number of buckets based on your data size and cluster configuration. Generally,
# the number of buckets should be a multiple of your executors and should not be too close to the number of distinct values in the bucketing column (to avoid creating empty buckets).
#
# Bucket DataFrame: Use the bucketBy function to specify the bucketing column and number of buckets.
# This function shuffles data and distributes it based on the bucket hash value calculated for each row's bucketing column value.
#
# Code Example (Python):

# Python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Sample DataFrame with customer purchase data
data = [
    (1, 100), (1, 200), (1, 50),  # Customer 1 has many purchases
    (2, 300), (3, 150)
]

df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["customer_id", "amount"])

# Bucketing column and number of buckets
bucket_col = "customer_id"
num_buckets = 4

# Bucket the DataFrame by customer_id with 4 buckets
#This function shuffles data and distributes it based on the bucket hash value calculated for each row's bucketing column value.
bucketed_df = df.bucketBy(num_buckets, bucket_col)

# Now you can perform joins or aggregations on bucketed_df

spark.stop()
# Use code with caution.
#
# Explanation:
#
# This code creates a sample DataFrame with customer purchase data.
# It defines customer_id as the bucketing column and sets the number of buckets to 4 (adjust as needed).
# The bucketBy function is used to bucket the DataFrame based on the chosen column and number of buckets.
# Benefits of Bucketing:
#
# Reduces data shuffling during joins and aggregations if the join/aggregation condition matches the bucketing column.
# Improves query performance, especially for skewed data.
# Important Notes:
#
# Bucketing introduces some overhead during data shuffling for bucketed writes.
# Bucketing effectiveness depends on choosing the right column and number of buckets. Experimentation might be needed to find the optimal configuration.
# Bucketing works best with co-partitioned tables for joins (both tables bucketed on the same column with the same number of buckets).
