Choosing the Right Level:

The optimal storage level depends on your specific use case:

Use MEMORY_ONLY or MEMORY_AND_DISK for frequently accessed data that fits in memory.
Use MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER for datasets that might not fit entirely in memory but need faster access compared to DISK_ONLY.
Use DISK_ONLY for large datasets that don't require frequent access and can reside on disk.
